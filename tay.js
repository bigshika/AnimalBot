  "Don't ask me what I think the best song of last year was, because my opinion is the same as most of America's. It was 'Gold Digger.'",
  "\"Everything I'm not made me everything I am.\" In my humble opinion, that's a prophetic statement. Gandhi would have said something like that.",
  "Come on now! How could you be me and want to be someone else?",

  "My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.",
  "You can't look at a glass half full or empty if it's overflowing.",
  "I have, like, nuclear power, like a superhero, like Cyclops when he puts his glasses on.",
  "Yeah. I'm rich and I'm famous, but I try not to be extra with it.",
  "A lot of people were wondering what I was going to do if I didn't win anything. I guess we'll never know.",
